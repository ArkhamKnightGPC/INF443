## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Basic 3D scene and shader effects

The objectives of this lab were to insert objects into a 3D scene and play with translations, rotations and shader effects controlled by the simulation's time parameter.

### Lab 2: Phong Shading

In order to visualize depth on the projected image, shading is essencial. In this lab, we developed a [Phong shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading#:~:text=Phong%20shading%20interpolates%20surface%20normals,and%20the%20Phong%20reflection%20model.) from scratch.

Additionally, a fog effect was added to make objects gradually fade away as distance increases.

### Lab 3: 3D modelisation

In this lab, we explored modeling 3D surfaces using their parametric description. We coded meshes for a 3D terrain and a tree that was then procedurally added at random positions of the terrain in the final scene.
